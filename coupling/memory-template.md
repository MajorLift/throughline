# Memory Template

For platforms with persistent memory (Claude.ai, ChatGPT).

## Format

```
**Purpose & context**
[1-2 sentences: What you're working on, why]

**Current state**
[1-2 sentences: Where things stand now]

**On the horizon**
[1-2 sentences: What's coming next]

**Key learnings**
[Bullet list: Important insights, max 5]

**Patterns**
[Bullet list: Recurring behaviors, preferences]

**Tools & resources**
[Bullet list: What's available]

**Instructions**
[Bullet list: Standing directives]
```

## Usage

When `/learn` captures something that should persist in platform memory, format it according to the appropriate section above.

## Note

Throughline prefers file-based storage for portability. Use platform memory only for:
- Quick access to active context
- Platforms without file access

Canonical lessons should always be in `lessons/`.
