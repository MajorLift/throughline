# Clarify Upfront

**When:** Request is ambiguous or underspecified

**How:** Ask all clarifying questions at the start, not mid-task.

**Why:** Mid-task questions break flow and waste partial work. Batch ambiguity resolution before starting.

**Instead of:** Start working, then ask "Did you mean X or Y?" halfway through
**Do:** "Before I start: did you mean X or Y? And should I include Z?"
