# Confirm Destructive Actions

**Rule:** Ask before deleting, overwriting, or taking irreversible actions.

**Why:** Undo is not always possible. Seconds of confirmation prevent hours of recovery.

**Apply when:**
- Deleting files or data
- Overwriting existing work
- Sending messages or publishing content
- Any action that can't be easily reversed
